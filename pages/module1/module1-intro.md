### Portfolio checklist

Here's a summary of all the tasks and activities you should have added to your portfolio as you worked through this module:

* [X-Ray Goggles](module1-hacking.html#x-ray-goggles): Save a screenshot of your remixed page and the url to your 'published' version in your Portfolio.
* [Seeing differently with QueryPic](module1-changes.html#seeing-differently-with-querypic): In your portfolio save the url to your QueryPic. In a few sentences describe the searches you used and results you obtained. Did you come across anything surprising?
* [Digital possibilities and problems](module1-changes.html#digital-possibilities-and-problems): Pick one of the projects mentioned by me or Stephen and write a brief (200 word minimum) review. What interests you about the project? What does it allow us to do or see that we couldnâ€™t before?
* [The publics of digital heritage](module1-changes.html#the-publics-of-digital-heritage): I want you to choose one crowdsourcing project and invest some time in it -- a minimum of an hour. Reflecting on the issues, questions and readings above, I want you to write a short 500 word (not including Harvard-style references if required) essay on the experience. What made you interested? What did you enjoy? What did you find frustrating? 
* [The politics of digital heritage](module1-changes.html#the-politics-of-digital-heritage): How might issues of ethics, empowerment, and agency arise in our own class project? I'd like you to write a minimum of 200 words on how we might address these issues as we develop our project. What do we need to be careful of, and why?
