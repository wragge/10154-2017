### Portfolio checklist

Here's a summary of all the tasks and activities you should have added to your portfolio as you worked through this module:

* [Treating text as data](module3-transform.html#treating-text-as-data): Repeat the searches you used to create your QueryPic chart in the ngram viewer. Try changing the corpus used and the capitalisation of your terms. In a minimum of 100 words describe the differences you observe.

* [Counting words](module3-transform.html#counting-words): Save the answers to the questions above in your portfolio.

* [Comparing texts](module3-transform.html#comparing-texts): Grab a screenshot of your streamgraph and save it and the url to your portfolio.

* [Overviewing with overview](module3-transform.html#overviewing-with-overview): Look at the two examples above carefully and think about how TF-IDF values are calculated. Can you find any interesting patterns in the speeches? Write a minimum of 100 words on what you notice. Then look at the Hansard word clouds -- a lot of the high-value words seem unfamiliar. Why do you think that is? You might notice 'Corinella' in the first cloud -- trying [searching for it in Historic Hansard](http://search.historichansard.net/?q=corinella&type=speeches&date_from=1901-01-01&date_to=1980-12-31&sort=score&house=&parliament=&speaker=&start=20). Can you work out why it has a high TF-IDF value in the period 1901-1910? Explain your theory in a minimum of 100 words.

* More soon...
